# Introduction
A lot of what I am going to say here is very subject to exceptions, so plase read the conclusion for the full list on times when to get a X570 motherboard if I didn't discuss it in the paragraphs specifically.

## PCIE Gen 4
* There has been a lot of buzz around "PCIE Gen 4", an improvement over Gen 3 which improves upon the total bus bandwidth allowing more data to be transferred. However, this is completely irrelevant for most users. The easiest difference to point out is the that all the general lane PCIE and NVME slots are PCIE Gen 4 on X570. Though, users who are actually using more than one PCIE Gen 4 NVME drive (more on this below) have either a big bank account or more likely to move over to xTR4 because chances are they are doing professional work (or are irresponsible). Currently, some Gen 4 drives are actually worse than mid/high-tier Gen 3 drives (that are cheaper) in terms of random speeds (are what determine how fast your games load) thereby rendering a consideration of Gen 4 moot for gaming. Oddly enough, some Gen 4 drives that will actually be better than current Gen 3 drives now--not because they are Gen 4, but because they have new controllers like Phison E18 or SM2267/SM2267/SM2264--still have firmware issues that put them among Gen 3 drives and not better (to be fixed sometime). Even if you are eyeing a good PCIE Gen 4 drive (of which the controllers aren't really optimized themselves nor software on windows currently), the speed difference is less than a single percent (of sub minute load times, basically not noticeable). They are very few people who would benefit from a Gen 4 drive. To the people who say Gen 4 is faster because bigger number better, I raise the example of why no drive is currently saturing the Gen 3 bus bandwidth and thus optimizing in a different way of "NAND"--Intel Optane 905p. If you are getting multiple NVME drives and using more SATA devices, X570 will not disable the extra SATA ports, which may be beneficial for you.
* The easiest difference to point out is the that all the general lane PCIE and NVME slots are PCIE Gen 4 on X570. Users who are actually using or needing more than one PCIE Gen 4 NVME drive have either a big bank account or more likely to move over to xTR4 because chances are they are doing professional work (or are just irresponsible).
